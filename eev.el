;;; Commentary:

;; I used to call eev a "tool for automating almost everything" and
;; "my project to save the world with Free Software". In more concrete
;; terms, eev is a library for Emacs that lets us create "executable
;; logs" of what we do in a format that is reasonably easy to read and
;; to modify, and that lets us "play back" those logs step by step in
;; any order.
;;
;; See the file README.org - or <http://anggtwu.net/#eev>, or
;; <https://github.com/edrx/eev#introduction> - for more information
;; and lots of links.
