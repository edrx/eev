* Introduction

I used to call eev a "tool for automating almost everything" and "my
project to save the world with Free Software". In more concrete terms,
eev is a library for Emacs that lets us create [[http://angg.twu.net/eev-intros/find-here-links-intro.html#1][executable logs]] of
what we do in a format that is reasonably easy to read and to modify,
and that lets us "play back" those logs step by step in any order.

The best introductions to eev are:

- "[[http://angg.twu.net/emacsconf2019.html][How to record executable notes with eev - and how to play them
  back]]": my talk at the EmacsConf 2019. Executable notes are mostly
  made of [[http://angg.twu.net/eev-intros/find-eev-quick-intro.html#3][sexp hyperlinks]] and [[http://angg.twu.net/eev-intros/find-eev-quick-intro.html#6][eepitch blocks]]. This talk has a quick
  explanation of sexp hyperlinks at [[http://angg.twu.net/LATEX/2019emacsconf.pdf#page=5][slides 5 and 6]], a mention in [[http://angg.twu.net/LATEX/2019emacsconf.pdf#page=8][slide
  8]] of my 20+ years of executable notes in [[http://angg.twu.net/e/]], and
  a very nice demo of playing back non-trivial executable notes in the
  video starting at [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86yiRG8YJD0#t=13m10s][13:10]]; the demo of eepitch starts at [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86yiRG8YJD0#t=15m11s][15:11]],

- "[[http://angg.twu.net/emacsconf2020.html][On why most of the best features in eev look like 5-minute hacks]]":
  my talk at the EmacsConf 2020. It is mostly about design decisions,
  but at [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOAqBc42Gg8#t=21m02s][21:02]] it shows how I use M-j to teach Emacs and eev to total
  beginners, and at [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOAqBc42Gg8#t=18m47s][18:47]] it explains the design decisions behind M-j.

- "[[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxBjiUo88_U][How to install eev with M-x list-packages and how to navigate its
  tutorials]]". This is a video tutorial accessible to total beginners -
  with an approach that is the exact opposite of "[[http://angg.twu.net/LATEX/2019emacsconf.pdf#page=10][users should not be
  forced to see Lisp]]".

* Trying it

The recommended way to try eev it to install it with M-x list-packages
and then run M-x eev-beginner; this will load all the modules of eev,
turn eev-mode on, and open the [[http://angg.twu.net/eev-intros/find-eev-quick-intro.html][main tutorial]]. I tried to make eev as
friendly as possible both to:

- beginners, who at first know only the most obvious keybindings, like
  the arrow keys, and no Lisp at all, and:

- experts, who want a very [[http://angg.twu.net/eev-intros/find-eev-intro.html#1][non-invasive]] package, with a mode that they
  can turn on and off easily (hint: M-x eev-mode), and that they can
  learn by playing with it just 5 minutes per week. The "expert setup"
  is explained [[http://angg.twu.net/eev-intros/find-eev-install-intro.html#1][here]]. The source code for M-x eev-beginner is [[http://angg.twu.net/eev-current/eev-beginner.el.html][here]].
