This is the README.md file for eev.

I used to call eev a "tool for automating almost everything" and "my
project to save the world with Free Software". In more concrete terms,
eev is a library for Emacs that lets us create _executable logs_ of
what we do in a format that is reasonably easy to read and to modify,
and that lets us "play back" those logs step by step in any order.

The tutorial at

  http://angg.twu.net/eev-intros/find-eev-quick-intro.html

explains the main ideas of eev - elisp hyperlinks, a way to control
shell-like programs ("eepitch"), and sandboxed tutorials (the
"find-xxx-intro"s) - quite clearly in its first sections. I've been
using it to teach Emacs and GNU/Linux to beginners.

Besides that tutorial the best introduction to eev is this video:

  How to record executable notes with eev - and how to play them back

  http://angg.twu.net/LATEX/2019emacsconf.pdf (slides)

Its slide 13 shows how beginners can learn eev by starting with just
two keys, M-j and M-e. See:

# Older videos

These two older videos are also interesting:

  Eepitch: a way to control shell-like programs from Emacs (2013)
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lj_zKC5BR64

  An introduction to eev2 (2012)
  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doeyn5MOaB8

The video about eepitch has a very nice demonstration of controlling
two shell-like programs at once - watch its first two minutes. Note: I
made these two videos before implementing the "find-xxx-intro"s, that
in the last few years became a central feature in eev.

The "quick intro" has installation instructions.
